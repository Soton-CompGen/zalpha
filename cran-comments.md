## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed a broken URI

* Added a reference to the description field of the DESCRIPTION file including a doi

Thanks to Uwe Ligges for the fix suggestions.

   * Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:
     DOI: 10.1534/genetics.115.185900
       From: DESCRIPTION

Mis-spelled words are author names. DOI is correct, https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.115.185900 goes to the correct reference.
